# enterprise-network-lab
This is a Enterprise Network and System Administrations lab that I improved upon from my old university course using cisco packet tracer. The core aim of the lab was to set up a star topology network where all devices are connected to a central device.

The new lab differs from the old lab in these key areas:
1) Added a router and the internet to the network instead of just having the devices and the switch.
2) Created virual devices using VirtualBox to simulate real-world devices on a network alongside a physical which held Windows 11 but was replaced with Ubuntu Linux to have different operating systems on the network.
3) Utilized Nagios to monitor the network paired with the simulation from cisco packet tracer to demonstrate end to end routing, and switching concepts.
